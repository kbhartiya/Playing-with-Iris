# Playing with Iris.
A simple K- Nearest Neighbour and K-means Clusteing  implementation of classifying iris flowers from scratch.

# For Linux users:
1.Go to the cloned directory.
2.Open Terminal.
	1.Run :
	'''
	python3 iris_visualization.py "num_features"
	'''
	-->Here num_features is the number of features among which you want to plot the graph.
	
	2.Run :
	'''
	python3 kmeans_iris.py
	'''
	--> It runs the K means clustering algorithm on the Iris Dataset and outputs the formed clusters.
	
	3.Run:
	'''
	python3 iris_knn.py "test_size"
	'''
	-->It runs the K Nearest Neighbour algorithm on the iris dataset.
	-->test_size is the fraction of data points you want as testing data.
